    <h1>The WWW project</h1>
    
    <p>The WorldWideWeb (W3) project allows all links to be made to any information
    anywhere. This includes other media types and access protocols. The project started
    in 1989 at CERN as a collaboration system for physicists working around the world.</p>
    
    <p>The WWW world consists of documents, and <a href="#">links</a>. Indexes are special documents which,
    rather than being read, may be <a href="#">searched</a>. The result of such a search is another
    ("virtual") document containing links to the documents found.</p>
    
    <p>A program which provides access to the hypertext world we call a <a href="#">browser</a>.</p>
