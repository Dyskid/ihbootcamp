                <h3>CSS Grid vs Flexbox: When to Use Which</h3>
                <time datetime="2024-01-05">January 5, 2024</time>
                <p>Both CSS Grid and Flexbox are powerful layout tools, but they serve different purposes. Flexbox is ideal for one-dimensional layouts, perfect for navigation bars, card layouts, and aligning items along a single axis.</p>
